## Stack

* GraphQL https://graphql.org/graphql-js/

* ExpressJS http://expressjs.com/

## Requirements

* Role-based permission management (graphql directives?)
* Document creation through file upload (csv -> mongoose handler)
* no frontend (will be separate)
* quick creation of new content types (or one flexible content type)
